Hello World!

git status
- Gives a status of files to be changed and changes to be committed

touch newfile.txt
- Creates and saves a blank text file named newfile.txt

git add <filename>
- Marks a file as being added to the staging environment (but does not actually add it yet)

git commit -m "Your message about the commit"
- Commits all changes to the main branch

git checkout -b <my branch name>
- Automatically creates a new branch, and then "checks you out" on it, meaning git will move you to that branch off the primary branch

git branch
- Shows the branches, including the one you are currently on and the main branch.


To create a new repo on GitHub, log in and go to the GitHub home page. You can find the “New repository” option under the “+” sign next to your profile picture, in the top right corner of the navbar:
GitHub will ask if you want to create a new repo from scratch or if you want to add a repo you have created locally. In this case, since we've already created a new repo locally, we want to push that onto GitHub so follow the '....or push an existing repository from the command line' section

git remote add origin https://github.com/dudziakpe/mynewrepository.git
- APPARENTLY THIS JUST DOESN'T WORK I GUESS??? EVEN THOUGH IT'S SUPPOSED TO?????????
- - Go to GitHub, account -> settings -> developer settings -> personal access tokens -> tokens (classic) -> generate new token, copy the token and paste it somewhere to access it again

- - git remote set-url origin https://<token>@github.com/<username>/<repo>
- We've created a repo locally, so we want to push that onto GitHub
- - The https should be given upon creating the repo

git push origin my-new-branch
- Push the commit in your branch to the new GitHub repo. This lets other people see the changes I've made.
- On the GitHub page, it shows the branch_2 had recent pushes, and you can compare and pull request.
